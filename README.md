# Data-Science-Projects

## Report
#### We chose to focus on the transportation sector for our project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
#### Our project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
#### Our focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
#### We collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars from Kaggle.
#### ML models we will use for prediction: 
* Linear Regression
* SVR
* Random Forest
* Ridge Regression 
* Lasso Regression

## Streamlit App
#### We've made a simple Streamlit App so we are able to see the result of our top two models. 
#### With the help from rmse and r^2score we see the result from our models. 
#### with theese histogram and boxplot we are able to get a clear idea how good our model is.
#### The first page is a description of what we want to show and to the left we have a Meny where you are able to change the model but also if you want to see that data and models and the result.

#### In this video, you can see how the app functions.
