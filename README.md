## Report
#### We chose to focus on the transportation sector for our project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
#### Our project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
#### Our focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
#### We collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars from Kaggle.
#### ML models we will use for prediction: 
* Linear Regression
* SVR
* Random Forest
* Ridge Regression 
* Lasso Regression
